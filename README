NAME
    Devel::Dt - Emulates command line flag -Dt but better

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Use the module and it'll immediately begin acting like you'd started
    your perl with -Dt.

     perl -MDevel::Dt -e 'print q(hi)'

    The above program results in the following output. There is an
    outstanding bug that the arguments to the operations aren't being
    dumped.
